# Regression

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like a salary for
example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model
is predicting present but unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random
Forests Regression.

We will implement:
1. Simple Linear Regression
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest regression
