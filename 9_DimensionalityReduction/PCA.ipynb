    "Most of the time, the data we are working with is not in a form that is suitable for machine learning algorithms. For example, a dataset may have a large number of features (columns) which may make it difficult to visualize. In such cases, it is a good idea to reduce the dimensionality of the data, i.e. reduce the number of features. This is where PCA comes in.\n",
